# Summary
The goal of this challenge was to develop a way to collect data from a user and select an itinerary based on user input of acceptable temperatures.

The first step of this analysis was generate 2,000 random sets of latitudes and longitudes. With these coordinate pairs, the nearest city was determined and the weather data was pulled from the OpenWeather services. 

The second step was to filter down the cites based on the temperature requirements that the user provided. The user could then click to find hotels within the cities. 

The last step was to create a 4 city trip with hotel information.
